# Programming Paradigms

Programming paradigms are fundamental styles or approaches to programming that shape how solutions are designed and implemented. Below are some of the major paradigms:

---

## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**Key Concepts:** Objects, Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
**Languages:** Java, C++, Python, C#, Ruby
**Description:**
OOP organizes code around **objects**, which are instances of **classes**—blueprints that define attributes and behaviors. It promotes code **reuse**, **modularity**, and **scalability**, making it ideal for large and complex software systems.

## 2. Functional Programming (FP)

**Key Concepts:** Pure Functions, Immutability, First-Class Functions, Higher-Order Functions
**Languages:** Haskell, Lisp, Elixir, Scala, JavaScript (partial)
**Description:**
FP emphasizes **declarative code** using pure functions and avoids mutable state and side effects. It’s rooted in **mathematical functions** and is well-suited for concurrent and parallel programming.

## 3. Procedural Programming (PP)

**Key Concepts:** Procedures (Functions), Sequence, Selection, Iteration
**Languages:** C, Pascal, Fortran, BASIC
**Description:**
Procedural programming structures programs as a series of **instructions** grouped into **procedures** or **routines**. It is a subset of imperative programming and is suitable for applications with a clear step-by-step logic.

## 4. Declarative Programming (DP)

**Key Concepts:** What to Do (Not How), Abstraction, Constraints
**Languages:** SQL, HTML, Prolog, Haskell
**Description:**
Declarative programming expresses the **logic of computation** without describing its control flow. The focus is on **what** the program should accomplish rather than detailing **how** to achieve it.

## 5. Logic Programming (LP)

**Key Concepts:** Facts, Rules, Queries, Inference
**Languages:** Prolog, Datalog
**Description:**
Logic programming is based on **formal logic**. Programs consist of a set of facts and rules, and computation is performed through **logical inference**. It is widely used in **AI**, **natural language processing**, and **expert systems**.
