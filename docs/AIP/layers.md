# Layers in Software Architecture

Software systems are often organized into logical layers, each responsible for a specific concern. This separation helps manage complexity, supports scalability, and improves testability.

---

## 1. Data Layer (Persistence Layer)

**Responsibility:**
Manages **storage**, **retrieval**, and **manipulation** of data from databases, file systems, or external APIs.
**Key Components:**

* Database access (SQL, ORM)
* Data models / entities
* Repositories / DAOs
  **Examples:**
* PostgreSQL, MongoDB
* SQLAlchemy, Hibernate
* `UserRepository`, `ProductDAO`

---

## 2. Application / Business Layer (Service Layer)

**Responsibility:**
Implements **business logic** and rules. It coordinates between the data and presentation layers, encapsulating core operations of the application.
**Key Components:**

* Services
* Use cases
* Domain logic
  **Examples:**
* `OrderService`, `AuthManager`
* Validating input, calculating discounts, enforcing rules

---

## 3. Presentation Layer (UI Layer)

**Responsibility:**
Handles **user interaction** and displays output. This layer communicates with the application layer to send input and present results.
**Key Components:**

* Web or mobile UI
* Controllers / ViewModels
* Frontend frameworks
  **Examples:**
* HTML, React, Flutter
* `LoginController`, `DashboardPage`

---

### Optional Extensions

If you're interested in a more complex architecture (like enterprise systems), you might also include:

* **API Layer:** For REST/GraphQL endpoints that expose services to clients.
* **Integration Layer:** Manages communication with external systems and services (e.g., third-party APIs).
* **Security Layer:** Handles authentication, authorization, and encryption across layers.
