# Code Level

Understanding code levels helps in organizing, scaling, and maintaining software projects effectively. Below is a hierarchy of common code abstraction levels:

---

## 1. Expression / Statement

**Description:**
The most basic unit of code that performs an action or produces a value.
**Examples:**

```python
x = 5         # Statement  
y = x + 2     # Expression within a statement
```

---

## 2. Function

**Description:**
A reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task, often with inputs (parameters) and outputs (return values).
**Example:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

---

## 3. Class

**Description:**
A blueprint for creating objects. Classes group related data and methods (functions) together, supporting object-oriented design.
**Example:**

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
```

---

## 4. File

**Description:**
A physical file (e.g., `.py`, `.js`) containing source code, which may include multiple functions, classes, or even runnable scripts.
**Example:**
`calculator.py` might contain all calculator-related classes and functions.

---

## 5. Module

**Description:**
A file or collection of files that define a namespace and can be imported into other files. Modules allow encapsulation and reuse.
**Example:**

```python
import math
from calculator import add
```

---

## 6. Package

**Description:**
A collection of related modules organized in a directory with an optional `__init__.py` file. Packages help group functionality logically.
**Example:**
`numpy`, `scikit-learn`, or your own directory like `myutils/`

---

## 7. Project

**Description:**
A complete application or system that may consist of multiple packages, configurations, tests, and documentation.
**Example:**
A Django web app or a machine learning pipeline.

---

## 8. Platform

**Description:**
A larger ecosystem or environment where projects are deployed, integrated, or distributed. May include OS, runtime environments, SDKs, or cloud infrastructure.
**Examples:**
AWS, Android, Windows, .NET, Node.js
