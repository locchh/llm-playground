    "## 3 - Understanding the Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='3-1'></a>\n",
    "### 3.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will explore how the different parameters of a language model (LLM) impact its output. Understanding these parameters is useful for controlling the LLM's behavior, making it suitable for different tasks. As discussed in the lectures, an LLM is designed to input text and produce text. However, a lot happens in the backend to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the input sequence is tokenized and vectorized. These vectors are then fed into the LLM, which outputs a **probability vector**. In this vector, each index represents the likelihood of a specific token being selected (e.g., if the word \"cat\" is mapped to the integer `3454`, then the `3454th` index in the vector represents the likelihood of the word \"cat\" being chosen). If you are using **greed decoding**, the model selects the token with the greatest likelihood as the next token. This token is appended to the initial sentence, and the process continues until either the `max_tokens` limit is reached or a special stop token is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that greedy decoding is **deterministic**. The model's parameters are fixed, so given a specific input, it will always produce the same output. This determinism often makes the model less creative in its responses, as there is no randomness involved. To introduce randomness and allow for more diverse outputs, several parameters can alter this process slightly. In this lab, you will explore two such parameters: `top_p` and `temperature`."

    "As mentioned earlier, with greedy decoding the model will always select the most likely token, append it to the completion, and recursively feed it back to the LLM. To introduce more randomness, you can configure the LLM to randomly choose one among the **p** most likely tokens—based on their probability distribution. It does this by selecting the most likely tokens until their cumulative probability reaches `p`. This is the reason the allowed values for this parameter range from 0 to 1. Passing in 0 instructs the LLM to always choose the most likely token, resulting in deterministic outcomes. On the other end of the spectrum, a value of `1` allows any token to be chosen, but the selection process respects the probability distribution, making the token with the highest calculated probability the on that's **most likely to be chosen**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept with a simple example: \n",
    "If the probability vector is $[0.6, 0.3, 0.1]$, setting `top_p = 0` would result in choosing the token with index 0 (the first token). Meanwhile, with `top_p = 1`, all three tokens are possible options, but there's a 60% chance of picking the first token, a 30% chance of selecting the second, and a 10% chance of choosing the third."

    "### 3.4 Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature parameter in a language model (LLM) is a **scalar** value that controls the randomness of the model's predictions. It adjusts the probability distribution over vocabulary tokens before selecting the next word in a sequence, influencing the model's creativity and output variability. Unlike `top_p`, the temperature can theoretically be any positive value, though model providers will sometimes set an upper limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/temperature.png\" alt=\"Temperature\" width=\"50%\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a probability vector $[0.3, 0.6, 0.1]$. The temperature modifies these probabilities by applying the following formula to each element in the vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{adjusted_probability}(p_i) = \\frac{\\exp(\\log(p_i) / \\text{temperature})}{\\sum \\exp(\\log(p_i) / \\text{temperature})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This involves:\n",
    "  - Scaling the logarithm of each probability by dividing it by the temperature.\n",
    "  - Exponentiating the result to obtain a new probability.\n",
    "  - Normalizing the probabilities so they sum to 1 again.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Effects of Different Temperature Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Low Temperature (<1):**\n",
    "  - Sharpens the probability distribution.\n",
    "  - Increases the difference between high and low probabilities, reinforcing deterministic selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Temperature (>1):**\n",
    "  - Flattens the distribution.\n",
    "  - Reduces differences between probabilities, increasing randomness in token selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature = 1:**\n",
    "  - Leaves the distribution unchanged, balancing creativity and determinism.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Point**: Setting `temperature = 1` does **not** make the result deterministic; Temperature adjusts the shape of the distribution but does not limit whether it's possible to select unlikely tokens at the far end of the distribution. Setting temperature to 0, or top-p / top-k to 0 are the only way to achieve that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the original token probability vector $[0.6, 0.3, 0.1]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature = 0.5 (Low):**\n",
    "  - Result vector: $[0.77, 0.18, 0.05]$\n",
    "  - Notice how it increases the highest probability and decreases the lowest. This makes the result more deterministic, as the most likely tokens become even more likely to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature = 1 (Neutral):**\n",
    "  - Result vector: $[0.6, 0.3, 0.1]$\n",
    "  - The probability distribution remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temperature = 2 (High):**\n",
    "  - Result vector: $[0.49, 0.27, 0.24]$\n",
    "  - The resulting probability vector is flatter, meaning less likely tokens have a greater chance of occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature significantly affects the final result by altering the probability distribution, unlike `top_p`, which doesn't change the distribution but expands the pool of tokens that can be chosen, maintaining their likelihood of occurrence. High temperature values may lead to nonsensical text. Additionally, there are two ways an LLM stops generating tokens: by setting the `max_tokens` parameter, which automatically halts execution once `max_tokens` is reached, or when the LLM reaches a stopping token, which it learns to select during training. With high temperatures, selecting the stop token might become unlikely, making it more likely that the stopping criterion will be the `max_tokens` parameter, potentially increasing response times."

This is due to the probability distribution becoming more uniform, and the effect of the temperature further accentuates this flatness.\n",
