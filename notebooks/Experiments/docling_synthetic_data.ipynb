    "Based on the content you provided from the mainframe book, here are some prompt examples you can use to generate synthetic data for training a language model (LLM) in various formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **QA (Question and Answer)**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Question**: \"What is the purpose of the `ACCEPT` statement in COBOL?\"\n",
    "- **Answer**: \"The `ACCEPT` statement transfers data or system date-related information into the data area referenced by the specified identifier. It reads input from a specified source, such as the system input device or a console.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Question**: \"What happens if no data is received when using the `ACCEPT` statement?\"\n",
    "- **Answer**: \"If no data is received from the console, the target data item does not receive a new value and retains its previous value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Summary**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Summary**: \"Summarize the section on the `ACCEPT` statement in COBOL.\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \"The `ACCEPT` statement in COBOL is used to transfer data from an input source, such as the system input device or console, into a data item. It handles system date-related information and user inputs, with no error checking or editing of the incoming data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Explain**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"Explain how the `ACCEPT` statement works in COBOL when the system input device is used.\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \"When the system input device is used with the `ACCEPT` statement, data is transferred into the receiving area, which can be an alphanumeric or national group item. The system reads records from the input device until the receiving area is filled or EOF is encountered. If the area is not completely filled, it is padded with spaces.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Code Generation**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"Generate a COBOL code snippet that uses the `ACCEPT` statement to read user input for age and gender.\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \n",
    "  ```cobol\n",
    "  ACCEPT AGE. \n",
    "  ACCEPT GENDER.\n",
    "  IF AGE > 60 AND GENDER = 'M' \n",
    "      DISPLAY 'THE MAN IS RETIRED' \n",
    "  ELSE IF AGE > 60 AND GENDER = 'F' \n",
    "      DISPLAY 'THE WOMAN IS RETIRED' \n",
    "  ELSE IF AGE <= 60 AND GENDER = 'M' \n",
    "      DISPLAY 'THE MAN IS NOT RETIRED' \n",
    "  ELSE IF AGE <= 60 AND GENDER = 'F' \n",
    "      DISPLAY 'THE WOMAN IS NOT RETIRED'\n",
    "  ELSE\n",
    "      DISPLAY 'INVALID INPUT'\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Autocomplete**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"Provide an autocomplete suggestion to fill in the following COBOL code: `ACCEPT ____`.\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \"ACCEPT identifier-1.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Auto-correct**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"Auto-correct the following COBOL code: `ACCEPT AGE GENDER`.\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \"The correct statement should be: `ACCEPT AGE. ACCEPT GENDER.`\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Synthetic Data Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Code Explanation**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"Explain what the `ADD` statement does in COBOL.\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \"The `ADD` statement sums two or more numeric operands and stores the result in the specified target identifier. The operands are added in a left-to-right order, and the sum is assigned to the identifier-2.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Edge Case Example**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Question**: \"What happens if more than 114 characters of data are entered in the `ACCEPT` statement?\"\n",
    "- **Answer**: \"If more than 114 characters of data are entered, only the first 114 characters will be recognized, and the rest will be ignored.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **Data Type Clarification**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Question**: \"What types of data items can the `ACCEPT` statement receive data into?\"\n",
    "- **Answer**: \"The `ACCEPT` statement can transfer data into alphanumeric, national group items, or elementary data items such as alphanumeric, numeric, national, and others, as long as they are not dynamic-length group items.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. **Best Practices**\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "- **Instruction**: \"What is a best practice when using the `ACCEPT` statement for input?\"\n",
    "- **Response**: \"Ensure that the receiving area has appropriate lengths and formats to handle the incoming data, and be aware of system-specific limitations, such as maximum input length and padding behavior.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These prompts provide diverse examples of synthetic data that could be used to train a language model in a variety of tasks related to COBOL and mainframe programming. Each example is designed to create different types of training data (QA, summaries, explanations, etc.), which helps diversify the model's learning."
