    "### Correlation Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a correlation matrix based on the grammar `SimpleLang.g4`, we can represent the grammar as a set of relationships between various grammar components and parse tree rules. The correlation matrix will help visualize how often each component or rule co-occurs with others, which is useful for understanding the structure and dependencies within the language. Let's consider a simplified matrix for this grammar:\n",

    "  - `0` indicates no direct relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- `program` correlates with multiple other rules (`statement`, `expression`) since it defines a program as one or more statements followed by the end-of-file (EOF).\n",

    "### Steps to Classify Statements Using a Token Correlation Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Tokens for Each Statement Type**:  \n",
    "   Each type of statement in the grammar (`variableDeclaration`, `assignment`, `printStatement`, `ifStatement`, `whileStatement`) involves specific tokens. For example:\n",
    "   - `variableDeclaration`: involves tokens like `let`, `IDENTIFIER`, `NUMBER`, `=`, and `;`.\n",
    "   - `assignment`: involves tokens like `IDENTIFIER`, `=`, `expression`, and `;`.\n",
    "   - `printStatement`: involves tokens like `print`, `(`, `expression`, `)`, and `;`.\n",
    "   - `ifStatement`: involves tokens like `if`, `(`, `expression`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `else`, and `{`.\n",
    "   - `whileStatement`: involves tokens like `while`, `(`, `expression`, `)`, `{`, and `}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Token Correlations**:  \n",
    "   For each type of statement, you can use the token correlation matrix to identify which tokens frequently occur together. This helps define the structure of each statement type based on its token composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Classify Based on Token Patterns**:  \n",
    "   After analyzing the correlations, you can use pattern recognition (e.g., machine learning models like decision trees, SVM, or a rule-based system) to classify a statement by matching its token correlation to a known pattern. For instance:\n",
    "   - If a statement has tokens like `let`, `IDENTIFIER`, and `=`, it's likely a `variableDeclaration`.\n",
    "   - If a statement has tokens like `IDENTIFIER`, `=`, and an `expression`, it’s likely an `assignment`.\n",
    "   - If a statement includes `print`, `(`, and `)`, it’s likely a `printStatement`.\n",
    "   - If a statement has `if`, `(`, and `else`, it’s likely an `ifStatement`.\n",
    "   - If a statement has `while`, `(`, and `)`, it’s likely a `whileStatement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build a Token-Correlation-Based Classifier**:\n",
    "   You could then use a model that operates on these token correlations:\n",
    "   - **Feature Extraction**: For each statement, extract the set of tokens it contains and the corresponding correlations.\n",
    "   - **Model Training**: Train a classifier using the extracted features to learn patterns of token co-occurrence specific to each statement type.\n",
    "   - **Classification**: When given a new statement, use the model to classify it based on the observed token correlation pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Token Correlation-Based Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example from the grammar:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statement**: `let x = 5;`\n",
    "  - Tokens: `let`, `IDENTIFIER (x)`, `=`, `NUMBER (5)`, `;`\n",
    "  - **Correlation Matrix**: Tokens like `let`, `IDENTIFIER`, and `NUMBER` co-occur frequently in a `variableDeclaration`.\n",
    "  - **Prediction**: The pattern matches `variableDeclaration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statement**: `x = 10;`\n",
    "  - Tokens: `IDENTIFIER (x)`, `=`, `NUMBER (10)`, `;`\n",
    "  - **Correlation Matrix**: Tokens like `IDENTIFIER`, `=`, and `NUMBER` frequently occur in an `assignment`.\n",
    "  - **Prediction**: The pattern matches `assignment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statement**: `print(x);`\n",
    "  - Tokens: `print`, `(`, `IDENTIFIER (x)`, `)`, `;`\n",
    "  - **Correlation Matrix**: Tokens like `print`, `(`, and `)` co-occur frequently in `printStatement`.\n",
    "  - **Prediction**: The pattern matches `printStatement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of This Approach:\n",
    "- **Token-based Classification**: This approach leverages token co-occurrence patterns to differentiate between statement types, which can be efficient and intuitive.\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: By capturing the underlying structure of statements based on tokens and their correlations, this method can improve the accuracy of classification, especially when there are subtle differences between statement types.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "- **Complex Statements**: If a statement type involves a wide variety of tokens (e.g., `ifStatement` or `whileStatement`), the classification might require more advanced techniques like sequence models or additional context beyond token correlation.\n",
    "- **Ambiguity**: Some tokens might overlap in different statement types (e.g., an `IDENTIFIER` can be part of multiple statement types), so additional context might be necessary for accurate classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying this method, you can classify statements based on their token correlations, which can then be used to parse and understand code in a structured way."

    "### Approach Using LLMs to Identify Token Correlation Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 1: Preprocess the Input**\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: First, tokenize the given statements or code snippets into tokens using a suitable tokenizer (e.g., using a pretrained tokenizer from a model like GPT, BERT, or similar).\n",
    "- These tokens could include keywords, operators, variables, literals, and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Use the LLM to Learn Token Relationships**\n",
    "- **Contextual Embeddings**: Instead of relying on simple co-occurrence, LLMs generate **contextual embeddings** for each token in a sentence. These embeddings capture not just the token itself but how it relates to other tokens within the given context.\n",
    "  - For example, the token `let` might have a different embedding in the context of a variable declaration (`let x = 5;`) than it does in the context of an assignment (`let y = x + 3;`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Obtain Embeddings for Tokens**:\n",
    "  - Pass the sentence (or code) through the LLM to obtain **token embeddings** for each token.\n",
    "  - Each token embedding is a high-dimensional vector that captures the semantic and syntactic relationships between tokens in the context.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Step 3: Measure Token Similarity**\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: Compute the similarity between token embeddings using **cosine similarity**. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, and a higher cosine similarity implies that the tokens are contextually related.\n",
    "  - Example: The similarity between `let` and `IDENTIFIER` might be high, as they often appear together in variable declarations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Building the Token Correlation Matrix**: Using the cosine similarity scores between token embeddings, create a **correlation matrix** where each entry (i, j) represents the similarity between tokens i and j.\n",
    "  - Higher values in the matrix indicate a stronger relationship between tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Fine-Tune the LLM (Optional)**\n",
    "- If the general-purpose LLM doesn't capture the specific relationships you want (e.g., relationships that are more syntactic, like operator precedence), you can **fine-tune** the LLM on a domain-specific corpus (e.g., programming languages, or code snippets).\n",
    "- Fine-tuning can improve the model's ability to capture domain-specific correlations, especially if the tokens follow particular syntactic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Extract Token Relationships**\n",
    "- **Contextual Relationships**: Once the correlation matrix is generated using the LLM, you can interpret it to see which tokens are closely related based on their embeddings.\n",
    "  - For example, you might find that keywords like `let` and `var` have similar embeddings because they are both used in variable declarations.\n",
    "  - Similarly, operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` might be correlated because they frequently appear together in arithmetic expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 6: Use the Correlation Matrix for Classification or Other Tasks**\n",
    "- **Classification**: With the token correlation matrix generated, you can use it as input to a downstream classification task. For instance, you could use this matrix as part of a feature set to classify statements as `VariableDeclaration`, `Assignment`, `IfStatement`, etc.\n",
    "- **Pattern Recognition**: The correlation matrix can also help in detecting syntactic or semantic patterns within code or text, which could be useful for code analysis, refactoring, or code completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using LLMs for Token Correlation:\n",
    "- **Context-Aware**: Unlike traditional methods (like co-occurrence matrices), LLMs capture the **contextual relationships** between tokens, which is crucial for understanding how tokens interact in more complex constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals, function calls).\n",
    "- **Semantic Understanding**: LLMs can capture **semantic relationships** that go beyond simple token pairings, allowing them to differentiate between tokens that might look similar syntactically but differ in meaning.\n",
    "- **Fine-Grained Relationships**: LLMs can capture subtle relationships between tokens (e.g., distinguishing between a keyword like `if` and a variable name like `if_name`), which might not be immediately obvious in traditional correlation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Let’s say you have the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `let x = 5;`\n",
    "2. `x = x + 1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "By passing these through an LLM, the token embeddings for `let`, `x`, `=`, and `5` would be generated. The cosine similarity between `let` and `x` might be high because they often co-occur in variable declarations. Similarly, the similarity between `x` and `+` might be high due to the arithmetic context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting correlation matrix might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Token     | let | x   | =   | 5   | +   |\n",
    "|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n",
    "| **let**   | 1   | 0.8 | 0.3 | 0.1 | 0.0 |\n",
    "| **x**     | 0.8 | 1   | 0.6 | 0.2 | 0.5 |\n",
    "| **=**     | 0.3 | 0.6 | 1   | 0.1 | 0.4 |\n",
    "| **5**     | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.1 | 1   | 0.0 |\n",
    "| **+**     | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 1   |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this matrix, the token `x` is strongly correlated with `let` and `=`, indicating that `x` often appears in the context of variable declarations and assignments. The relationship between `x` and `+` is also relatively strong, indicating that `x` is commonly used in arithmetic expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Using LLMs to identify token correlations offers several benefits over traditional methods. By leveraging contextual embeddings, LLMs can capture deeper semantic and syntactic relationships between tokens, making them a powerful tool for building a more refined and accurate token correlation matrix."
