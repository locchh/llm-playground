    "### Providing Feedback During a Run\n",
    "\n",
    "The [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) is a special built-in agent that acts as a proxy for a user to provide feedback to the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent), you can create an instance of it and include it in the team before running the team. The team will decide when to call the [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) to ask for feedback from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in a [RoundRobinGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat) team, the [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) is called in the order in which it is passed to the team, while in a [SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) team, the selector prompt or selector function determines when the [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates how you can use [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) to get feedback from the user during a team’s run:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/_images/human-in-the-loop-user-proxy.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The bold arrows indicates the flow of control during a team’s run: when the team calls the `UserProxyAgent`, it transfers the control to the application/user, and waits for the feedback; once the feedback is provided, the control is transferred back to the team and the team continues its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Note**: *When [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) is called during a run, it blocks the execution of the team until the user provides feedback or errors out. This will hold up the team’s progress and put the team in an unstable state that cannot be saved or resumed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the blocking nature of this approach, it is recommended to use it only for short interactions that require immediate feedback from the user, such as asking for approval or disapproval with a button click, or an alert requiring immediate attention otherwise failing the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use the [UserProxyAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.UserProxyAgent) in a [RoundRobinGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat) for a poetry generation task:"

    "### Using Max Turns\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to pause the team for user input by setting a maximum number of turns. For instance, you can configure the team to stop after the first agent responds by setting `max_turns` to 1. This is particularly useful in scenarios where continuous user engagement is required, such as in a chatbot.\n",
