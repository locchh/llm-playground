    "In this section you’ll learn how to create an multi-agent workflow using [GraphFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.GraphFlow), or simply “flow” for short. It uses structured execution and precisely controls how agents interact to accomplish a task.\n",

Supports sequential, parallel, conditional, and looping behaviors.\n",

    "**When should you use [GraphFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.GraphFlow)?** *Use Graph when you need strict control over the order in which agents act, or when different outcomes must lead to different next steps. Start with a simple team such as [RoundRobinGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat) or [SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) if ad-hoc conversation flow is sufficient. Transition to a structured workflow when your task requires deterministic control, conditional branching, or handling complex multi-step processes with cycles.*"

    "### Key Takeaways for Activation Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `activation_group`: Groups edges that point to the same target node, allowing you to define different dependency patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `activation_condition`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"all\"` (default): Target node waits for ALL edges in the group to be satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"any\"`: Target node executes as soon as ANY edge in the group is satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cycles with multiple entry points: Different activation groups prevent conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Priority-based execution: Mix “all” and “any” conditions for different urgency levels\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallel processing with early termination: Use “any” to proceed with the fastest result\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Best Practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use descriptive group names (`\"critical\"`, `\"optional\"`, `\"feedback\"`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep activation conditions consistent within the same group\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test your graph logic with different execution paths\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns enable sophisticated workflow control while maintaining clear, understandable execution semantics.\n"
