While AutoGen simplifies the process of working with teams, start with a single agent for simpler tasks, and transition to a multi-agent team when a single agent proves inadequate. Ensure that you have optimized your single agent with the appropriate tools and instructions before moving to a team-based approach."

    "\n",
    "[SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) implements a team where participants take turns broadcasting messages to all other members. A generative model (e.g., an LLM) selects the next speaker based on the shared context, enabling dynamic, context-aware collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model-based speaker selection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Configurable participant roles and descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prevention of consecutive turns by the same speaker (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable selection prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable selection function to override the default model-based selection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customizable candidate function to narrow-down the set of agents for selection using model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: *[SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) is a high-level API. For more control and customization, refer to the Group Chat Pattern in the Core API documentation to implement your own group chat logic.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "[SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) is a group chat similar to [RoundRobinGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat), but with a model-based next speaker selection mechanism. When the team receives a task through `run()` or `run_stream()`, the following steps are executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The team analyzes the current conversation context, including the conversation history and participants’ [name](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.base.html#autogen_agentchat.base.ChatAgent.name) and [description](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.base.html#autogen_agentchat.base.ChatAgent.description) attributes, to determine the next speaker using a model. By default, the team will not select the same speak consecutively unless it is the only agent available. This can be changed by setting `allow_repeated_speaker=True`. You can also override the model by providing a custom selection function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The team prompts the selected speaker agent to provide a response, which is then **broadcasted** to all other participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The termination condition is checked to determine if the conversation should end, if not, the process repeats from step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When the conversation ends, the team returns the [TaskResult](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.base.html#autogen_agentchat.base.TaskResult) containing the conversation history from this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the team finishes the task, the conversation context is kept within the team and all participants, so the next task can continue from the previous conversation context. You can reset the conversation context by calling [reset()](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.BaseGroupChat.reset).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Web Search/Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate how to use `SelectorGroupChat` with a simple example for a web search and data analysis task.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/_images/selector-group-chat.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This system uses three specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning Agent**: The strategic coordinator that breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web Search Agent**: An information retrieval specialist that interfaces with the `search_web_tool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analyst Agent**: An agent specialist in performing calculations equipped with `percentage_change_tool`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools `search_web_tool` and `percentage_change_tool` are external tools that the agents can use to perform their tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The task is received by the `SelectorGroupChat` which, based on agent descriptions, selects the most appropriate agent to handle the initial task (typically the Planning Agent).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Planning Agent analyzes the task and breaks it down into subtasks, assigning each to the most appropriate agent using the format: `<agent> : <task>`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Based on the conversation context and agent descriptions, the `SelectorGroupChat` manager dynamically selects the next agent to handle their assigned subtask.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Web Search Agent performs searches one at a time, storing results in the shared conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The Data Analyst processes the gathered information using available calculation tools when selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The workflow continues with agents being dynamically selected until either:\n",
    "- The Planning Agent determines all subtasks are complete and sends “TERMINATE”\n",
    "- An alternative termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining your agents, make sure to include a helpful description since this is used to decide which agent to select next."

    "\n",
    "[Magentic-One](https://aka.ms/magentic-one-blog) is a generalist multi-agent system for solving open-ended web and file-based tasks across a variety of domains. It represents a significant step forward for multi-agent systems, achieving competitive performance on a number of agentic benchmarks (see the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04468) for full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "When originally released in November 2024 Magentic-One was [implemented directly on the autogen-core library](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/v0.4.4/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one). We have now ported Magentic-One to use `autogen-agentchat`, providing a more modular and easier to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the Magentic-One orchestrator [MagenticOneGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.MagenticOneGroupChat) is now simply an AgentChat team, supporting all standard AgentChat agents and features. Likewise, Magentic-One’s [MultimodalWebSurfer](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_ext.agents.web_surfer.html#autogen_ext.agents.web_surfer.MultimodalWebSurfer), [FileSurfer](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_ext.agents.file_surfer.html#autogen_ext.agents.file_surfer.FileSurfer), and [MagenticOneCoderAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_ext.agents.magentic_one.html#autogen_ext.agents.magentic_one.MagenticOneCoderAgent) agents are now broadly available as AgentChat agents, to be used in any AgentChat workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there is a helper class, [MagenticOne](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_ext.teams.magentic_one.html#autogen_ext.teams.magentic_one.MagenticOne), which bundles all of this together as it was in the paper with minimal configuration.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Example: The figure above illustrates Magentic-One multi-agent team completing a complex task from the GAIA benchmark. Magentic-One’s Orchestrator agent creates a plan, delegates tasks to other agents, and tracks progress towards the goal, dynamically revising the plan as needed. The Orchestrator can delegate tasks to a FileSurfer agent to read and handle files, a WebSurfer agent to operate a web browser, or a Coder or Computer Terminal agent to write or execute code, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Caution**\n",
    "Using Magentic-One involves interacting with a digital world designed for humans, which carries inherent risks. To minimize these risks, consider the following precautions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Containers**: Run all tasks in docker containers to isolate the agents and prevent direct system attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Virtual Environment**: Use a virtual environment to run the agents and prevent them from accessing sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Monitor Logs**: Closely monitor logs during and after execution to detect and mitigate risky behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human Oversight**: Run the examples with a human in the loop to supervise the agents and prevent unintended consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limit Access**: Restrict the agents’ access to the internet and other resources to prevent unauthorized actions.\n",
    "\n",

    "![img](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/_images/autogen-magentic-one-agents.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Magentic-One work is based on a multi-agent architecture where a lead Orchestrator agent is responsible for high-level planning, directing other agents and tracking task progress. The Orchestrator begins by creating a plan to tackle the task, gathering needed facts and educated guesses in a Task Ledger that is maintained. At each step of its plan, the Orchestrator creates a Progress Ledger where it self-reflects on task progress and checks whether the task is completed. If the task is not yet completed, it assigns one of Magentic-One other agents a subtask to complete. After the assigned agent completes its subtask, the Orchestrator updates the Progress Ledger and continues in this way until the task is complete. If the Orchestrator finds that progress is not being made for enough steps, it can update the Task Ledger and create a new plan. This is illustrated in the figure above; the Orchestrator work is thus divided into an outer loop where it updates the Task Ledger and an inner loop to update the Progress Ledger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Magentic-One consists of the following agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Orchestrator**: the lead agent responsible for task decomposition and planning, directing other agents in executing subtasks, tracking overall progress, and taking corrective actions as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WebSurfer**: This is an LLM-based agent that is proficient in commanding and managing the state of a Chromium-based web browser. With each incoming request, the WebSurfer performs an action on the browser then reports on the new state of the web page The action space of the WebSurfer includes navigation (e.g. visiting a URL, performing a web search); web page actions (e.g., clicking and typing); and reading actions (e.g., summarizing or answering questions). The WebSurfer relies on the accessibility tree of the browser and on set-of-marks prompting to perform its actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FileSurfer**: This is an LLM-based agent that commands a markdown-based file preview application to read local files of most types. The FileSurfer can also perform common navigation tasks such as listing the contents of directories and navigating a folder structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coder**: This is an LLM-based agent specialized through its system prompt for writing code, analyzing information collected from the other agents, or creating new artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ComputerTerminal**: Finally, ComputerTerminal provides the team with access to a console shell where the Coder’s programs can be executed, and where new programming libraries can be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, Magentic-One’s agents provide the Orchestrator with the tools and capabilities that it needs to solve a broad variety of open-ended problems, as well as the ability to autonomously adapt to, and act in, dynamic and ever-changing web and file-system environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the default multimodal LLM we use for all agents is GPT-4o, Magentic-One is model agnostic and can incorporate heterogonous models to support different capabilities or meet different cost requirements when getting tasks done. For example, it can use different LLMs and SLMs and their specialized versions to power different agents. We recommend a strong reasoning model for the Orchestrator agent such as GPT-4o. In a different configuration of Magentic-One, we also experiment with using OpenAI o1-preview for the outer loop of the Orchestrator and for the Coder, while other agents continue to use GPT-4o."

    "## Swarm\n",
    "\n",
    "[Swarm](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm) implements a team in which agents can hand off task to other agents based on their capabilities. It is a multi-agent design pattern first introduced by OpenAI in [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm). The key idea is to let agent delegate tasks to other agents using a special tool call, while all agents share the same message context. This enables agents to make local decisions about task planning, rather than relying on a central orchestrator such as in [SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat).\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Caution**: *[Swarm](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm) is a high-level API. If you need more control and customization that is not supported by this API, you can take a look at the [Handoff Pattern](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/core-user-guide/design-patterns/handoffs.html) in the Core API documentation and implement your own version of the Swarm pattern.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the [Swarm](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.Swarm) team is a group chat where agents take turn to generate a response. Similar to [SelectorGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) and [RoundRobinGroupChat](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat), participant agents broadcast their responses so all agents share the same message context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the other two group chat teams, at each turn, **the speaker agent is selected based on the most recent [HandoffMessage](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.messages.html#autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage) message in the context**. This naturally requires each agent in the team to be able to generate [HandoffMessage](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.messages.html#autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage) to signal which other agents that it hands off to.\n",
    "\n",
    "For [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent), you can set the `handoffs` argument to specify which agents it can hand off to. You can use [Handoff](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.base.html#autogen_agentchat.base.Handoff) to customize the message content and handoff behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall process can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each agent has the ability to generate [HandoffMessage](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.messages.html#autogen_agentchat.messages.HandoffMessage) to signal which other agents it can hand off to. For [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent), this means setting the handoffs argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the team starts on a task, the first speaker agents operate on the task and make localized decision about whether to hand off and to whom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When an agent generates a HandoffMessage, the receiving agent takes over the task with the same message context.\n",
    "\n",

    "**⚠️ Caution**: *The [AssistantAgent](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.agents.html#autogen_agentchat.agents.AssistantAgent) uses the tool calling capability of the model to generate handoffs. This means that the model must support tool calling. If the model does parallel tool calling, multiple handoffs may be generated at the same time. This can lead to unexpected behavior. To avoid this, you can disable parallel tool calling by configuring the model client. For [OpenAIChatCompletionClient](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_ext.models.openai.html#autogen_ext.models.openai.OpenAIChatCompletionClient) and [AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_ext.models.openai.html#autogen_ext.models.openai.AzureOpenAIChatCompletionClient), you can set `parallel_tool_calls=False` in the configuration.*\n",
