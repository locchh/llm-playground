To handle ambiguous cases in ANTLR using Python, you can embed code to manage custom resolution strategies. Ambiguities arise when multiple parsing paths can apply to the same input, such as for expressions with nested parentheses or operator precedence.

Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating embedded Python code to handle an ambiguous case:

### Problem Statement: Ambiguity in Expression Parsing
Consider the arithmetic grammar where the input `1 + 2 * 3` can be parsed in multiple ways:
- `(1 + 2) * 3`
- `1 + (2 * 3)`

We'll use embedded Python code to enforce precedence rules during parsing.

### Grammar File: `Expression.g4`

```antlr
grammar Expression;

@header {
# This section runs at the start of the parser initialization
print("Initializing Expression Parser with Ambiguity Handling...")
}

@members {
# Custom method for debugging or resolving ambiguities
def resolve_ambiguity(self, rule, value):
    print(f"Resolving ambiguity at rule: {rule}, computed value: {value}")
    return value
}

prog: expr EOF { print("Finished parsing program."); };

expr returns [int value]
    : e1=term {$value = $e1.value;} ('+' e2=term { $value = self.resolve_ambiguity("addition", $value + $e2.value); })* # Add
    ;

term returns [int value]
    : e1=factor {$value = $e1.value;} ('*' e2=factor { $value = self.resolve_ambiguity("multiplication", $value * $e2.value); })* # Multiply
    ;

factor returns [int value]
    : INT { $value = int($INT.text); } # Integer
    | '(' e=expr ')' { $value = self.resolve_ambiguity("parentheses", $e.value); } # Parentheses
    ;

INT: [0-9]+; // Matches integers
WS: [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip; // Skip whitespace
```

### Key Features of the Grammar
1. **Embedded Python Code for Ambiguity Resolution**:
   - The `resolve_ambiguity` method is defined in the `@members` section. It logs and returns the resolved value for each operation.

2. **Explicit Precedence Rules**:
   - Higher precedence for multiplication (`term`) over addition (`expr`) is enforced by the grammar structure.

3. **Debugging Ambiguity**:
   - The embedded Python code inside `{ ... }` is used to log and handle the ambiguities during parsing.

### Generate Python Parser
Run the ANTLR command to generate Python files:

```bash
antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 Expression.g4
```

---

### Python Script: `main.py`
```python
from antlr4 import *
from ExpressionLexer import ExpressionLexer
from ExpressionParser import ExpressionParser

# Input expression with potential ambiguity
input_stream = InputStream("1 + 2 * 3")

# Create lexer and parser
lexer = ExpressionLexer(input_stream)
token_stream = CommonTokenStream(lexer)
parser = ExpressionParser(token_stream)

# Parse and evaluate
tree = parser.prog()
```

---

### Output
When you run the script, the output will trace how ambiguities are resolved:

```plaintext
Initializing Expression Parser with Ambiguity Handling...
Resolving ambiguity at rule: multiplication, computed value: 6
Resolving ambiguity at rule: addition, computed value: 7
Finished parsing program.
```

---

### Explanation
- The `resolve_ambiguity` method ensures that all ambiguities are logged and handled consistently.
- The precedence is naturally handled by the grammar structure (`term` for multiplication, `expr` for addition).
- Embedded code provides hooks for any additional logic required to manage ambiguities.

This approach combines grammar design and embedded Python code to robustly handle ambiguities in parsing. Let me know if you'd like further clarifications!

**Note**: Error `IndentationError: unexpected indent` may happen when generating code, need to adjust a little bit.
