    "| **Structure**            | Can have multiple connected components and cycles. | A single connected component with a hierarchy (parent-child relationship). |\n",
    "| **Edges**                | Edges can be directed or undirected; multiple edges between two nodes (multi-edges) are allowed. | Edges are directed, typically from a parent node to a child node. There is only one edge between any two nodes. |\n",

    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Graphs**:\n",
    "1. **Social Networks**: Graphs can represent users as nodes and connections (e.g., friendships) as edges. Algorithms like PageRank or community detection can be applied.\n",
    "2. **Routing Algorithms**: In networking or transportation systems, graphs represent paths and intersections, and algorithms like Dijkstra’s help find the shortest path.\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Systems**: In collaborative filtering, users and items are connected, and a graph structure helps find similarities or recommend items.\n",
    "4. **Dependency Graphs**: Used in build systems or package managers to represent dependencies between software modules.\n",
    "5. **Web Crawling**: Web pages as nodes, and hyperlinks as edges to traverse the internet or index pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Trees**:\n",
    "1. **File Systems**: The structure of directories and files is hierarchical, with the root directory at the top and files as leaf nodes.\n",
    "2. **Database Indexing**: B-trees and binary search trees are used to store sorted data for fast retrieval in databases.\n",
    "3. **Decision Trees**: Used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks where each internal node represents a decision, and the leaves represent outcomes.\n",
    "4. **XML/JSON Parsing**: Represents data with a clear hierarchy where elements are nodes, and child nodes are related to the parent node (e.g., DOM tree).\n",
    "5. **Game Trees**: In artificial intelligence, used to represent possible moves in games (e.g., chess, tic-tac-toe), where each node represents a game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- **Graphs** are ideal for representing complex and flexible relationships, where cycles and multiple paths between nodes are common.\n",
    "- **Trees** are better suited for hierarchical structures where relationships are acyclic, and there's a clear parent-child structure."

    "The main difference between a **graph** and a **tree** lies in their structure and properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graph**: A graph is a general structure that consists of **nodes (vertices)** connected by **edges**. Graphs can have any number of edges between nodes, can be **directed or undirected**, and may contain **cycles** (paths where a node can be revisited). There is no inherent hierarchical structure, and a node may have any number of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tree**: A tree is a **special type of graph** that is **connected, acyclic**, and has a **hierarchical structure**. It has a single **root node** from which all other nodes (called child nodes) are descended. In a tree:\n",
    "  - There are **no cycles**.\n",
    "  - Each node, except the root, has exactly **one parent**.\n",
    "  - There is exactly **one path** between any two nodes.\n",
    "  - Trees are always **connected**, meaning all nodes are reachable from the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "1. **Cycles**:\n",
    "   - **Graph**: Can contain cycles (a node can be part of a cycle).\n",
    "   - **Tree**: Cannot contain cycles (it is acyclic).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Hierarchy**:\n",
    "   - **Graph**: No inherent hierarchy.\n",
    "   - **Tree**: Has a **hierarchical structure** with one root node and parent-child relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connectivity**:\n",
    "   - **Graph**: May be disconnected (not all nodes are reachable from others).\n",
    "   - **Tree**: Always connected (except in the case of a forest, which is a collection of disjoint trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Number of Paths**:\n",
    "   - **Graph**: Multiple paths between nodes are allowed.\n",
    "   - **Tree**: There is only **one path** between any two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a **tree** is a **special type of graph** that has strict rules about connectivity, acyclicity, and hierarchy. All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees."

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Error Handling and Validation**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: The `get_adjacent_vertices` method contains a typo (`vertext`) and redundant checks for vertex existence. Also, the method does not handle invalid input gracefully.\n",
    "   - **Fix**:\n",
    "     - Correct the typo and simplify the logic.\n",
    "     - Add validation for invalid input across the class methods, e.g., raising exceptions when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Updated `get_adjacent_vertices`**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def get_adjacent_vertices(self, vertex):\n",
    "       if vertex not in self.graph:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(f\"Vertex '{vertex}' does not exist in the graph.\")\n",
    "       return self.graph[vertex]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Edge Addition Logic**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: The `add_edge` method assumes that vertices not already in the graph should be automatically added. This behavior might not always be desirable and could lead to unintended consequences.\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Consider making vertex addition explicit or providing a flag to toggle this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Alternative**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def add_edge(self, src, dest, auto_add_vertices=True):\n",
    "       if auto_add_vertices:\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Performance Considerations**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: Removing a vertex is inefficient because it iterates over all adjacency lists to remove edges to the vertex. This is \\(O(V+E)\\), which might be slow for large graphs.\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Use a more efficient data structure, like `defaultdict` for adjacency lists, or a set instead of a list for edges, to make lookups and deletions faster (\\(O(1)\\)).\n",

    "       def __init__(self, directed=False):\n",

    "           self.directed = directed\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Security and Integrity**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: The class does not validate the input data type for vertices and edges. Passing mutable or complex objects might lead to unpredictable behavior.\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Enforce type checks to ensure vertices are hashable and edges are well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Type Enforcement**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def add_vertex(self, vertex):\n",
    "       if not isinstance(vertex, (int, str, float)):  # Adjust based on use case\n",
    "           raise TypeError(\"Vertex must be a hashable type (int, str, float).\")\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 5. **Documentation and Usability**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: The class lacks docstrings, making it hard for users to understand its behavior without inspecting the code.\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Add docstrings for each method to clarify functionality and expected inputs/outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Readability and Code Quality**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: There are inconsistencies in comments and indentation, and some comments are incorrect (e.g., \"Create edge from dst, src\" instead of \"dest, src\").\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Use consistent, clear comments and maintain proper formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Edge Case Handling**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: Removing a vertex or edge does not handle cases where the vertex/edge does not exist gracefully.\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Provide meaningful error messages or handle these cases silently based on the desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def remove_vertex(self, vertex):\n",
    "       if vertex not in self.graph:\n",
    "           raise ValueError(f\"Vertex '{vertex}' does not exist.\")\n",

    "           self.graph[adj].discard(vertex)  # Use set for efficient removal\n",
    "       del self.graph[vertex]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Testing and Debugging**\n",
    "   - **Issue**: No tests are provided to verify correctness.\n",
    "   - **Fix**: Write unit tests for all methods, covering edge cases such as:\n",
    "     - Adding duplicate vertices/edges.\n",
    "     - Removing non-existent vertices/edges.\n",
