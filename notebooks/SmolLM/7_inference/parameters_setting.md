# Understanding `top_k`, `top_p`, and `temperature` in Language Models

## 1. **Overview of Parameters**
Language models use **`top_k`**, **`top_p`**, and **`temperature`** to control text generation. These parameters help balance randomness and coherence by filtering and modifying token probabilities before sampling the next word.

### **1.1 `temperature` (Probability Scaling)**
- **Definition**: Adjusts the probability distribution by scaling token probabilities.
- **Effect**:
  - **Low `temperature`** (e.g., `0.1`) → More deterministic, favors the most probable words.
  - **High `temperature`** (e.g., `1.5`) → Increases randomness.
- **Typical Values**:
  - `temperature = 0` → Fully deterministic (greedy decoding).
  - `temperature = 0.7` → Balanced randomness.
  - `temperature > 1.2` → Creative but potentially incoherent.

### **1.2 `top_k` (K Best Sampling)**
- **Definition**: Keeps only the **top `k` most probable words** and discards the rest.
- **Effect**:
  - **High `top_k`** → More diversity but potential incoherence.
  - **Low `top_k`** → More deterministic, less diverse.
- **Typical Values**:
  - `top_k = 1` → Greedy decoding (always picks the highest probability word).
  - `top_k = 5–50` → Balanced.
  - `top_k > 100` → Almost unrestricted, leading to randomness.

### **1.3 `top_p` (Nucleus Sampling)**
- **Definition**: Keeps only the **smallest set of words** whose cumulative probability reaches at least `p`.
- **Effect**:
  - **Low `top_p`** (e.g., `0.1`) → Highly restricted, only considers the most probable words.
  - **High `top_p`** (e.g., `0.9`) → More flexible, but might introduce errors.
- **Typical Values**:
  - `top_p = 0.9` → Commonly used for controlled randomness.
  - `top_p = 0.5` → Balanced between focus and diversity.
  - `top_p = 1.0` → No restriction, allowing complete randomness.

## 2. **Processing Order of `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`**
The model processes these settings in a strict order:

1️⃣ **Apply `temperature` first** → Adjust probabilities before filtering.
2️⃣ **Apply `top_k` next** → Keep the top `k` words.
3️⃣ **Apply `top_p` last** → Keep the smallest set of words that sum up to probability `p`.

### **Example Process**
If the model predicts these probabilities:
| Word  | Original Probability |
|-------|----------------------|
| "happy" | 40% |
| "joyful" | 30% |
| "excited" | 15% |
| "content" | 10% |
| "ecstatic" | 5% |

#### **Step 1: Apply `temperature = 0.7`** (Adjusts probabilities)
| Word  | Adjusted Probability |
|-------|----------------------|
| "happy" | ~38% |
| "joyful" | ~28% |
| "excited" | ~14% |
| "content" | ~12% |
| "ecstatic" | ~8% |

#### **Step 2: Apply `top_k = 3`** (Keep top 3 words)
| Word  | Adjusted Probability |
|-------|----------------------|
| "happy" | ~38% |
| "joyful" | ~28% |
| "excited" | ~14% |

#### **Step 3: Apply `top_p = 0.8`** (Keep smallest set summing to 80%)
| Word  | Final Probability |
|-------|------------------|
| "happy" | ~38% |
| "joyful" | ~28% |
| "excited" | ~14% |

4️⃣ **Final Sampling** → A word is randomly chosen from the remaining words based on the final probabilities.

## 3. **Special Cases and Edge Behaviors**
| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `temperature = 0` | Always picks the most probable word (greedy decoding). |
| `top_k = 1` | Same as greedy decoding; always selects the most probable word. |
| `top_k` too high (e.g., `top_k > 100`) | Almost unrestricted, leading to excessive randomness. |
| `top_k` too low (e.g., `top_k = 1–2`) | Too deterministic, might sound unnatural. |
| `top_p` too high (e.g., `top_p > 0.9`) | Unrestricted sampling, potentially incoherent responses. |
| `top_p` too low (e.g., `top_p < 0.1`) | Only selects 1–2 words, making responses rigid. |

## 4. **Recommended Settings Based on Use Case**
| Use Case | `temperature` | `top_k` | `top_p` | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Factual Q&A** | `0.3-0.6` | `5-10` | `0.3-0.7` | Keeps answers precise and coherent. |
| **Creative Writing** | `0.8-1.5` | `40-100` | `0.9-1.0` | Adds randomness and diversity for storytelling. |
| **Summarization** | `0.3-0.7` | `10-20` | `0.5-0.8` | Keeps summaries concise and meaningful. |
| **Chatbots** | `0.6-1.0` | `20-50` | `0.7-0.95` | Allows flexibility while keeping coherence. |
| **Code Generation** | `0.2-0.6` | `10-30` | `0.5-0.8` | Ensures structured and logical output. |
| **Poetry Generation** | `1.0-1.5` | `50-100` | `0.9-1.0` | Encourages highly creative and free-flowing text. |
| **Legal Document Writing** | `0.2-0.5` | `5-20` | `0.3-0.6` | Ensures precision and compliance with structured text. |
| **Scientific Paper Writing** | `0.3-0.6` | `10-30` | `0.4-0.7` | Keeps content structured, formal, and factual. |

## **5. Conclusion**
- Use **low `temperature`** for deterministic output and **higher `temperature`** for creativity.
- Use **`top_k` to limit words** and **`top_p` to dynamically restrict selection**.
- **For factual or structured output**, lower `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`.
- **For storytelling or dialogue**, increase `temperature`, `top_k`, and `top_p`.
