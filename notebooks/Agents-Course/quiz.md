    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],
    model=HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")
)
```

### Assessment Criteria:


- Web agent has correct tools configured
- Manager agent properly references web agent
- Appropriate max_steps value is set
- Required imports are authorized


### Reference Solution:
```python
web_agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool(), visit_webpage],
    model=model,
    max_steps=10,
    name="search",
    description="Runs web searches for you."
)

manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    managed_agents=[web_agent],
    additional_authorized_imports=["time", "numpy", "pandas"]
)
```

## Question 3: Configure Agent Security Settings

### Assessment Criteria:


- E2B sandbox is properly configured
- Authorized imports are appropriately limited
- Security settings are correctly implemented
- Basic agent configuration is maintained


### Reference Solution:
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, E2BSandbox

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[],
    model=model,
    sandbox=E2BSandbox(),
    additional_authorized_imports=["numpy"]
)
```

## Question 4: Implement a Tool-Calling Agent

### Assessment Criteria:

- Tools are properly configured
- Step limit is set appropriately
- Agent name and description are provided
- Basic configuration is complete


### Reference Solution:
```python
from smolagents import ToolCallingAgent

agent = ToolCallingAgent(
    tools=[custom_tool],
    model=model,
    max_steps=5,
    name="tool_agent",
    description="Executes specific tools based on input"
)
```

## Question 5: Set Up Model Integration

### Assessment Criteria:

- Correct model imports are included
- Model is properly initialized
- Model ID is correctly specified
- Alternative model option is provided


### Reference Solution:
```python
from smolagents import HfApiModel, LiteLLMModel

# Hugging Face model
hf_model = HfApiModel("Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")

# Alternative model via LiteLLM
other_model = LiteLLMModel("anthropic/claude-3-sonnet")
```
