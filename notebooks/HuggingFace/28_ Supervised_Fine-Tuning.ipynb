    "##  Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a process primarily used to adapt pre-trained language models to follow instructions, engage in dialogue, and use specific output formats. While pre-trained models have impressive general capabilities, SFT helps transform them into assistant-like models that can better understand and respond to user prompts. This is typically done by training on datasets of human-written conversations and instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This page provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) model using the [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer). By following these steps, you can adapt the model to perform specific tasks more effectively."

    "### When to Use SFT\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation, it’s important to understand when SFT is the right choice for your project. As a first step, you should consider whether using an existing instruction-tuned model with well-crafted prompts would suffice for your use case. SFT involves significant computational resources and engineering effort, so it should only be pursued when prompting existing models proves insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider SFT only if you: \n",
    "- Need additional performance beyond what prompting can achieve\n",
    "- Have a specific use case where the cost of using a large general-purpose model outweighs the cost of fine-tuning a smaller model\n",
    "- Require specialized output formats or domain-specific knowledge that existing models struggle with\n",
    "\n",
    "If you determine that SFT is necessary, the decision to proceed depends on two primary factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Template Control\n",
    "\n",
    "SFT allows precise control over the model’s output structure. This is particularly valuable when you need the model to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate responses in a specific chat template format\n",
    "2. Follow strict output schemas\n",
    "3. Maintain consistent styling across responses\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Domain Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Teaching domain terminology and concepts\n",
    "2. Enforcing professional standards\n",
    "3. Handling technical queries appropriately\n",
    "4. Following industry-specific guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting SFT, evaluate whether your use case requires: \n",
    "- Precise output formatting\n",
    "- Domain-specific knowledge\n",
    "- Consistent response patterns\n",
    "- Adherence to specific guidelines\n",
    "\n",

This feature allows multiple short examples to be packed into the same input sequence, maximizing GPU utilization during training. To enable packing, simply set `packing=True` in the SFTConfig constructor. When using packed datasets with `max_steps`, be aware that you may train for more epochs than expected depending on your packing configuration. You can customize how examples are combined using a formatting function - particularly useful when working with datasets that have multiple fields like question-answer pairs. For evaluation datasets, you can disable packing by setting `eval_packing=False` in the SFTConfig. Here’s a basic example of customizing the packing configuration:\n",

    "\n",
    "Effective monitoring is crucial for successful fine-tuning. Let’s explore what to watch for during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Understanding Loss Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Training loss typically follows three distinct phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial Sharp Drop: Rapid adaptation to new data distribution\n",
    "2. Gradual Stabilization: Learning rate slows as model fine-tunes\n",
    "3. Convergence: Loss values stabilize, indicating training completion\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/nlp_course_sft_loss_graphic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Metrics to Monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective monitoring involves tracking quantitative metrics, and evaluating qualitative metrics. Available metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training loss\n",
    "- Validation loss\n",
    "- Learning rate progression\n",
    "- Gradient norms\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch for these warning signs during training: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Validation loss increasing while training loss decreases (overfitting)\n",
    "2. No significant improvement in loss values (underfitting)\n",
    "3. Extremely low loss values (potential memorization)\n",
    "4. Inconsistent output formatting (template learning issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  The Path to Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "As training progresses, the loss curve should gradually stabilize. The key indicator of healthy training is a small gap between training and validation loss, suggesting the model is learning generalizable patterns rather than memorizing specific examples. The absolute loss values will vary depending on your task and dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Monitoring Training Progress\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph above shows a typical training progression. Notice how both training and validation loss decrease sharply at first, then gradually level off. This pattern indicates the model is learning effectively while maintaining generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Warning Signs to Watch For\n",
    "\n",
    "Several patterns in the loss curves can indicate potential issues. Below we illustrate common warning signs and solutions that we can consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/sft_loss_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the validation loss decreases at a significantly slower rate than training loss, your model is likely overfitting to the training data. Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing the training steps\n",
    "- Increasing the dataset size\n",
    "- Validating dataset quality and diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![fig](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/sft_loss_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the loss doesn’t show significant improvement, the model might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learning too slowly (try increasing the learning rate)\n",
    "- Struggling with the task (check data quality and task complexity)\n",
    "- Hitting architecture limitations (consider a different model)\n",
    "  \n",
    "![fig](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/sft_loss_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Extremely low loss values could suggest memorization rather than learning. This is particularly concerning if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model performs poorly on new, similar examples\n",
    "- The outputs lack diversity\n",
    "- The responses are too similar to training examples\n",
    "\n",
    "*Monitor both the loss values and the model's actual outputs during training. Sometimes the loss can look good while the model develops unwanted behaviors. Regular qualitative evaluation of the model's responses helps catch issues that metrics alone might miss.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We should note that the interpretation of the loss values we outline here is aimed on the most common case, and in fact, loss values can behave on various ways depending on the model, the dataset, the training parameters, etc. If you interested in exploring more about outlined patterns, you should check out this blog post by the people at [Fast AI](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/)."
