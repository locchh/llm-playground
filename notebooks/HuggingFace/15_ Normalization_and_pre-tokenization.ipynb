It considers the text as a sequence of Unicode characters, and replaces spaces with a special character, `‚ñÅ`. Used in conjunction with the Unigram algorithm (see [section 7](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/7)), it doesn‚Äôt even require a pre-tokenization step, which is very useful for languages where the space character is not used (like Chinese or Japanese).\n",
