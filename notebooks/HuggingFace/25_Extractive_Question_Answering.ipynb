    "Time to look at question answering! This task comes in many flavors, but the one we’ll focus on in this section is called extractive question answering. This involves posing questions about a document and identifying the answers as spans of text in the document itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will fine-tune a BERT model on the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/), which consists of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles. This will give us a model able to compute predictions like this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually showcasing the model that was trained and uploaded to the Hub using the code shown in this section. You can find it and double-check the predictions [here](https://huggingface.co/huggingface-course/bert-finetuned-squad?context=%F0%9F%A4%97+Transformers+is+backed+by+the+three+most+popular+deep+learning+libraries+%E2%80%94+Jax%2C+PyTorch+and+TensorFlow+%E2%80%94+with+a+seamless+integration+between+them.+It%27s+straightforward+to+train+your+models+with+one+before+loading+them+for+inference+with+the+other.&question=Which+deep+learning+libraries+back+%F0%9F%A4%97+Transformers%3F).\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Encoder-only models like BERT tend to be great at extracting answers to factoid questions like “Who invented the Transformer architecture?” but fare poorly when given open-ended questions like “Why is the sky blue?” In these more challenging cases, encoder-decoder models like T5 and BART are typically used to synthesize the information in a way that’s quite similar to [text summarization](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/5). If you’re interested in this type of generative question answering, we recommend checking out our [demo](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html) based on the [ELI5 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5)."

    "As we can see, our example has been in split into four inputs, each of them containing the question and some part of the context. Note that the answer to the question (“Bernadette Soubirous”) only appears in the third and last inputs, so by dealing with long contexts in this way we will create some training examples where the answer is not included in the context. For those examples, the labels will be `start_position = end_position = 0` (so we predict the [CLS] token). We will also set those labels in the unfortunate case where the answer has been truncated so that we only have the start (or end) of it.

To go faster, we also won’t score all the possible (start_token, end_token) pairs, but only the ones corresponding to the highest `n_best` logits (with `n_best=20`). Since we will skip the softmax, those scores will be logit scores, and will be obtained by taking the sum of the start and end logits (instead of the product, because of the $rulelog⁡(ab)=log⁡(a)+log⁡(b)$.\n",

Since we have not trained our model yet, we are going to use the default model for the QA pipeline to generate some predictions on a small part of the validation set. We can use the same processing function as before; because it relies on the global constant `tokenizer`, we just have to change that object to the tokenizer of the model we want to use temporarily:"

The `accelerator.prepare()` method changes the model to work in distributed training, so it won’t have the `save_pretrained()` method anymore; the `accelerator.unwrap_model()` method undoes that step.
