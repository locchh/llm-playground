## Develop Grammar

Here‚Äôs a refined and completed version of your section, including a polished ‚ÄúTips‚Äù subsection and maintaining your intended style and tone:

### ü§ù Develop Grammar Process with AI

#### Step 1: Co-Develop Documentation with AI

* Start with an **official language reference document** (or a well-prepared mini reference document of approximately 5 pages).
* Collect **around 10 typical source code files** written in the target programming language.
* Collaborate with an AI assistant to **generate a concise Mini Programming Language Document** in Markdown format.
* The goal is to help you **understand the language‚Äôs syntax, structure, and patterns** by building a tailored reference document with the help of AI.

#### üí° Tips

* You can extract relevant **syntax examples** from the source code files and present them to the AI in isolation. This helps the AI:

  * Recognize and generalize common patterns.
  * Infer the underlying grammar rules.
  * Provide clearer documentation sections and grammar suggestions.
* Include both **valid and invalid** code examples to help the AI identify potential ambiguities or parsing issues.
* Organize examples by category (e.g., variable declaration, control flow, functions) to improve structure and accuracy.

#### Step 2: Write a Pseudo Grammar and Collaborate with AI

* Based on your **Mini Programming Language Documentation** and the **typical source code files**, attempt to **write a draft of the grammar yourself**.
* This grammar can be in **pseudo-grammar format** ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt need to follow ANTLR or BNF exactly, but it should clearly describe the structure of language constructs (e.g., statements, expressions, blocks).
* Once the pseudo grammar is drafted, ask the AI assistant to **enhance and refine it**, but request that it **strictly follows your original format and structure**.

#### üí° Tips

* Keep the format consistent across rules (e.g., using `ruleName ‚Üí components`).
* Use indentation or bullets if needed to show optional parts or alternatives.
* Label each rule clearly (e.g., `function ‚Üí 'func' identifier '(' parameters ')' block`).
* Mention assumptions, like case sensitivity, reserved words, or comment styles.

#### **Example Prompt to AI**

```text
Here is my pseudo grammar based on my documentation and code samples. Please improve the grammar rules while strictly preserving my format. Do not rewrite the entire structure ‚Äî only enhance or correct what‚Äôs necessary.
```

#### **Step 3: Parse Code Using the Grammar with a Gradual Content-Growth Strategy**

* Use your current grammar to **incrementally parse** code files from the beginning.
* Apply a **gradual content-growth strategy**:

  * Start by parsing a **small portion** of the code (e.g., the first few lines).
  * If it **parses successfully**, gradually **add more lines** of the code.
  * If a **parse error occurs**, **stop** and fix the grammar or the input based on the error.
  * Repeat the process until the **entire file is successfully parsed**.

#### **üí° Why This Strategy Works**

* A **gradual content-growth strategy** helps you:

  * Identify exactly **where the grammar breaks down**.
  * Isolate and **fix errors incrementally**, reducing debugging complexity.
  * Maintain **better control over error handling and grammar refinement**.

#### **Optional Tools**

* Use tools like **ANTLRWorks**, **ANTLR Preview (in VS Code)**, or **custom Python scripts** to test parsing behavior.
* Log successful parses and failures to **track grammar coverage**.

### üìò Mini Programming Language Documentation Format

#### 1. **Usage**

* Describe the purpose and use cases of the mini programming language.
* Include target users and real-world scenarios where it can be applied.

---

#### 2. **Assessment Criteria**

Provide the evaluation framework for reviewing code written in the mini programming language:

* **Input/Output**
  Define expected input formats and output behavior.

* **Dependencies**
  List required libraries, external tools, or runtime environments.

* **Utilities**
  Specify built-in functions, helper scripts, or reusable modules.

* **Data Handling**

  * **Data Declarations**: Syntax for defining variables, constants, etc.
  * **Data Structures**: Supported structures like arrays, records, or objects.
  * **Database/Storage**: Integration details for persistent storage, if applicable.

---

#### 3. **Common Syntax and Examples**

* Showcase frequently used language features with examples.
* Include explanations for control structures (e.g., `if`, `loop`, `function`), assignments, and expressions.

---

#### 4. **Uncommon or Advanced Syntax**

* Highlight rare or advanced language features.
* Mention edge cases or syntax extensions not typically used in beginner code.

---

#### 5. **Code Snippets**

* Provide useful code snippets and idioms.
* Include patterns for error handling, data manipulation, or interaction with utilities.

---

#### 6. **References**

* Link to the official grammar file (e.g., ANTLR `.g4` file).
* Include links to tutorials, documentation, related papers, or libraries.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Grammar Issues (Syntax Errors)

Common parsing errors that may arise when using this language with a parser such as ANTLR:

* **no viable alternative at input** *(most critical)*
  The parser couldn‚Äôt decide how to proceed due to ambiguous or incomplete grammar.

* **mismatched input**
  The input did not match the expected token at a given point.

* **extraneous input**
  The parser encountered unexpected tokens not fitting the rule.

### ü§ñ Prompt Template for AI Collaboration

Use the following prompt when asking an AI assistant for help with parsing or debugging:

```prompt
Explain this error: {error}
When using this grammar: {grammar}
To parse this code: {code}
Suggest a fix or improved grammar rule.
```
