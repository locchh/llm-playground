You can absolutely transcoded Japanese text from one encoding (say, EUC-JP, ISO-2022-JP, or Shift\_JIS) into another (UTF-8 or Shift\_JIS) without altering the “look” of the characters, as long as:

1. You decode the bytes using the *correct* source encoding
2. You re-encode into the *desired* target encoding
3. You normalize if you care about Unicode canonical form (NFC vs NFD), to keep combining marks consistent

Here are a couple of straightforward ways:

---

## 1. Using the `iconv` command‐line tool

```bash
# Convert from EUC-JP to UTF-8
iconv -f euc-jp -t utf-8 input.txt > output_utf8.txt

# Convert from UTF-8 to Shift_JIS
iconv -f utf-8 -t shift_jis input_utf8.txt > output_sjis.txt
```

* `-f` specifies the **from** encoding
* `-t` specifies the **to** encoding
* This will faithfully preserve every Japanese character’s visual form.

If you need normalization (to NFC), you can pipe through `uconv` (from ICU):

```bash
iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 input.txt | uconv -x any-nfc > normalized.txt
```

## 2. In Python

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import io
import unicodedata

# 1) Read the original bytes, decoding with the correct source encoding:
with open("input_sjis.txt", "rb") as f:
    data = f.read()
text = data.decode("shift_jis")

# 2) Optionally normalize (e.g. NFC) to ensure canonical character forms:
text = unicodedata.normalize("NFC", text)

# 3) Write out as UTF-8 (or shift_jis) bytes:
with io.open("output_utf8.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(text)

# Or back to Shift_JIS:
with io.open("output_sjis.txt", "w", encoding="shift_jis") as f:
    f.write(text)
```

### Why normalization?

Even if two characters *look* the same, Unicode can represent them in multiple ways (e.g. composed vs. decomposed). Using `unicodedata.normalize("NFC", …)` ensures every character is in its composed form, which you want if you’re preserving exact visuals and avoiding surprises.

### Key tips

* **Always** use the *correct* source encoding when decoding.
* Don’t do a blind “re-encode” without decoding first.
* If you ever see “?,” “�,” or other replacement marks, it means a character couldn’t round-trip—in that case, double-check your source encoding.

With those steps you’ll maintain perfect visual fidelity when going between Shift\_JIS, UTF-8, EUC-JP, etc.
