# üßæ Report: On the Feasibility of a Universal Code Report Template for Context-Free Programming Languages

In short: **No**, you **cannot create a truly universal single template report** that covers *every possible implementation* across all **context-free languages** like Python, COBOL, etc.

However, you **can create a flexible, extensible reporting framework or template system** that handles a **broad range of use cases**, provided you define a **limited scope or abstraction level**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why a Single Universal Template is Not Feasible

| Challenge                               | Explanation                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Semantics vary**                      | Even if languages are context-free, their semantics (meaning) differ greatly. E.g., COBOL `PERFORM` vs. Python `for` loop.   |
| **Control flow representation differs** | COBOL uses paragraph/section jumps; Python uses structured blocks. One report structure can't describe both in the same way. |
| **Type systems differ**                 | Python is dynamically typed; COBOL is statically typed and record-oriented. Reports on variables or types must adapt.        |
| **Code styles differ**                  | COBOL is declarative and procedural; Python can be procedural, object-oriented, or functional.                               |
| **Tooling mismatch**                    | Syntax trees, parse info, and runtime data differ across ecosystems (ANTLR for COBOL vs. Python AST).                        |

### ‚úÖ What You *Can* Do Instead

#### 1. **Create a Meta-Template Framework**

Define a **template with placeholders or dynamic sections**, like:

```text
## Module: {{ module_name }}
- Language: {{ language }}
- Purpose: {{ module_description }}
- Functions / Sections:
{% for func in functions %}
  - {{ func.name }}: {{ func.description }}
{% endfor %}

## Control Flow:
{{ control_flow_diagram }}

## Data Handling:
{{ data_structures_summary }}

## External Dependencies:
{{ external_calls }}
```

This works well **if you plug in language-specific interpreters/parsers** that populate the same schema.

---

#### 2. **Use an Intermediate Representation (IR)**

Tools like:

* **ANTLR Parse Trees** (for COBOL, Java, etc.)
* **Python AST or `astroid`**
* **Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST)** from **CodeQL** or **BabelFish**

can be mapped to a **common schema** to feed into your template.

---

#### 3. **Limit Scope to Specific Aspects**

You could make reusable report templates for:

* Function summary
* Variable usage
* Control flow graphs
* Input/output formats
* Data model structure

and then use conditional logic depending on the language.

---

### üìå Conclusion

* ‚ùå You can't make *one* fixed report template that universally describes all implementations across all context-free languages.
* ‚úÖ You can build a **template engine** or **schema-based reporting framework** that generates tailored reports from normalized code data (e.g., ASTs).
* ‚öôÔ∏è This usually requires **language-specific preprocessing** to map code into the same abstract structure.
