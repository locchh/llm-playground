### 🧠 **1. Touch Becomes Vision (Neuroplasticity)**

* In people blind from birth or early life, the **visual cortex**—usually used for seeing—is repurposed.
* When they read Braille, **parts of their brain that sighted people use for reading print or seeing** are activated by **touch instead**.
* This is a powerful example of **neuroplasticity**, where the brain rewires itself to adapt.

> 👉 In blind Braille readers, **the occipital lobe (visual cortex)** helps interpret tactile information.

### ✋ **2. Finger Sensation Is Highly Refined**

* The brain of a blind person becomes more sensitive to **fine touch and spatial patterns**.
* Their **somatosensory cortex** (which processes touch) is highly active.
* The fingertips become like "eyes," scanning and recognizing dot patterns at high speed.

### 🧠🗣 **3. Language Processing Kicks In**

* As with sighted reading, **language areas of the brain** (like Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas) are heavily involved.
* The brain decodes Braille symbols into letters, words, and meaning—just like reading printed text.

---

### ⏱ **4. Working Memory and Mental Mapping**

* Braille reading involves remembering the previous few characters or words—so **working memory** is crucial.
* The brain builds a **mental map** of lines, paragraphs, and pages just like a sighted person visualizes a printed page.

### 🌌 Summary:

> For a blind person reading Braille:

* **Touch becomes the main sensory input**.
* The **visual cortex helps interpret tactile signals**.
* **Language and memory systems work together** to understand and follow the text.
* **Their brain is literally wired differently**, using vision areas for touch and reading.
