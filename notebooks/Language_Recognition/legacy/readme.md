# üìä Code Analysis Toolkit

This project provides a suite of tools for **static analysis** and **reverse engineering** of source code, particularly useful for legacy systems and mainframe applications. It aims to improve code quality, support modernization, and assist in understanding complex logic flows.

## üîç Static Analysis Features

Gain deeper insights into your codebase with the following capabilities:

1. **Syntax Analysis**
   Ensures the source code conforms to the defined grammar of the programming language. It helps detect syntax errors early in the development cycle.

2. **Flowchart Generation**
   Automatically generates visual diagrams that represent the logical structure and execution paths of programs, making complex code easier to understand.

3. **Control Flow Analysis**
   Examines the order in which statements or instructions execute. This is essential for debugging, optimization, and understanding the code‚Äôs execution behavior.

4. **Data Flow Analysis**
   Tracks how data is defined, used, and modified throughout the program. Useful for identifying dead code, uninitialized variables, and potential bugs.

5. **Data Structure Analysis**
   Analyzes the usage and performance characteristics of data structures in the code. It supports refactoring and performance tuning.

6. **Data Dependency Analysis**
   Identifies relationships and dependencies between variables and data elements, which is valuable for understanding code impact and improving modularity.

## üîÅ Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering allows users to transform complex, undocumented legacy code into understandable visual and structural artifacts.

Typical outputs include:

* Flowcharts for logic visualization
* Abstract representations of control and data dependencies
* Parsed structures of legacy code for easier migration or documentation
