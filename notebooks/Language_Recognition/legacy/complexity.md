## ðŸ§© Types of Complexity

### 1. **Syntactic Complexity**

* **Definition:** How complex the code's **structure or syntax** is (e.g., deeply nested code, long expressions).
* **Measured by:**

  * Line count, nesting depth, number of tokens or AST nodes.
* **Related to:**
  âœ… **Syntax Understanding**
* **Example:** Deeply nested `if` or `switch` statements.

### 2. **Cyclomatic Complexity (McCabe Complexity)**

* **Definition:** Measures the number of **independent paths** through a program.
* **Calculated from:**
  âœ… **Control Flow Graph (CFG)**
* **Formula:**
  `M = E - N + 2P`
  where:

  * `E` = edges in the CFG
  * `N` = nodes
  * `P` = number of connected components (usually 1 for a single function)
* **Related to:**
  âœ… **Static Behavior Understanding**
* **Why it matters:**

  * Indicates test case requirements.
  * High complexity â†’ harder to test, understand, and maintain.

### 3. **Cognitive Complexity**

* **Definition:** How hard the code is for a human to read and understand.
* **Goes beyond:** Just control structures â€” considers readability, nesting, and mental effort.
* **Used in tools like:** SonarQube.
* **Related to:**
  âœ… **Syntax + Static Behavior Understanding**

### 4. **Runtime Complexity (Dynamic Complexity)**

* **Definition:** Describes how complex the **actual execution** is, considering inputs, data states, and runtime paths.
* **Measured by:**

  * Number of function calls, branching at runtime.
  * Execution trace length or variability.
* **Related to:**
  âœ… **Dynamic Behavior Understanding**
* **Example:** A function that behaves very differently depending on runtime data.
