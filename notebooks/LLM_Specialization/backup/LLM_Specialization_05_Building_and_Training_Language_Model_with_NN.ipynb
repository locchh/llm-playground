    "This project serves as an introduction to the field of language modeling, focusing on creating a text generator tailored for composing 90s rap songs. You will utilize histogram N-gram models, implemented through the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This approach allows us to construct revealing histograms, shedding light on nuanced cadences of word frequencies and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These initial steps lay the foundation for understanding the intricacies of linguistic patterns. Progressing forward, you will delve into the domain of neural networks within the PyTorch framework. Within this realm, you will engineer a feedforward neural network, immersing ourselves in concepts such as embedding layers. You will also refine the output layer, tailoring it for optimal performance in language modeling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this journey, you are going explore various training strategies and embrace fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including tokenization and sequence analysis. As you traverse this enriching path, you will gain profound insights into the art of generating text, culminating in the ability to craft 90s rap lyrics that resonate with the era's unique style and rhythm.\n",

Perplexity is commonly used in natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, speech recognition, and language generation.\n",
