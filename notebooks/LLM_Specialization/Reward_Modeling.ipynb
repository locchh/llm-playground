    "# Reward Modeling\n",
    "Imagine that you're working as a machine learning engineer for a large technology company that wants to integrate advanced language models into its suite of AI-powered products. Your task is to evaluate and select the best large language model (LLM) that can understand and follow complex instructions, improve the quality of automated customer service, and generate high-quality responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply choosing a powerful LLM isn't enough. To truly excel in these tasks, the model should be fine-tuned to align with specific goals and criteria. This is where reward models come into the picture. By training a reward model, you can guide the LLM to prioritize certain behaviors, ensuring it generates responses that not only meet technical standards but also align with the company's values and objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you dive into the process of creating and training a reward model by using the transformer reinforcement learner (trl) library from Hugging Face. You learn how to set up the environment, define the rewards that shape the model's behavior, and fine-tune the LLM to perform with precision. This project equips you with the skills to implement reward models in real-world applications, enhancing the effectiveness and quality of AI-powered products.\n",

This includes things like pumps, growing trays, grow lights, and nutrients. Once you've assembled the system, you'll need to add your choice of herbs to the system. Lastly, you'll need to monitor and adjust the system as needed to ensure your herbs are getting the correct amount of light, water, and nutrients.\n",

    "The next step is training, saving, and evaluating a model by using the `RewardTrainer`. The `trainer.train()` method initiates the training process, where the model learns from the training data set, optimizing its parameters to improve performance. After training, the `trainer.save_model(output_dir)` method saves the trained model to the specified output directory, allowing for future use or deployment. Finally, the `trainer.evaluate()` method evaluates the model's performance on the evaluation data set, returning metrics that provide insights into how well the model performs. These metrics are then printed to give a detailed view of the model's evaluation results. \n",

    "The `RewardTrainer` uses pairwise comparison to measure the model's ability to distinguish between high and low-quality responses. In pairwise comparison, the model is presented with two responses: one chosen as the preferred response and one as the less preferred (rejected) response. The model evaluates each response in the pair and assigns a score or reward based on its learned criteria. To perform an evaluation, two separate responses are inputted, and the model generates a score that is logit for each response. The response with the higher score is selected as the preferred one, demonstrating the model's capability to accurately prioritize better responses.\n",

The `tokenizer` function processes the input text into tensors with padding and truncation to ensure uniform input length, up to a maximum of 512 tokens. The `inputs` are then moved to the GPU, if available, for faster computation. The `model` is also transferred to the GPU. The inputs dictionary is updated to move all of its items to the device (GPU or CPU).\n",

The score, the logits from the model's output, are extracted, representing the raw predictions. These logits are then passed through a sigmoid function to convert them into probabilities, which can be interpreted as the model's confidence in the projections. The resulting probabilities are printed or returned for further use.\n"

After applying a brush of carpet cleaning solution, it’s important to keep the stain removed.  You should then immediately replace the brush with a new one.

      "\n",
      "Assistant: Start by selecting a high-quality steak that has been properly aged and cut. Once you have your steak, season it generously with salt and pepper. Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over high heat for about 5 minutes. Place the steak in the skillet and allow to cook, undisturbed, for 6 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steak and the desired doneness. Flip the steak with a spatula, and cook for another 6 to 8 minutes. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, usually 125 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit for medium-rare. Once you reach the desired temperature, remove the steak from the pan, tent loosely with foil and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving. score: -5.251270771026611\n",

      "Assistant: Sure! Economics is the study of how individuals and societies decide to use their resources, such as labor and money, in order to meet their needs and wants. It examines how people interact with each other and with their environment in order to understand how an economy works. The core concepts of economics are supply and demand, opportunity cost, and the production possibilities frontier. Supply is the maximum amount of a product or service that can be provided. Demand is the amount of a product or service that people want. Opportunity cost is the cost of something when the choice to buy or not buy something else is taken into account. The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the alternatives a society can produce given a certain amount of resources. Understanding these concepts will help you get a better understanding of economics. score: -3.1698615550994873\n",
